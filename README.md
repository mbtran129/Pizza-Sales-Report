## 3. Suggestions
### 3.1. Operation
- Before 11:30 a.m., the number of orders was almost very small. Therefore, store working hours should be adjusted to optimize operating costs.
- Customers seem not to favor extra-large-sized pizzas. Therefore, you can consider eliminating these types of pizza.
- The Brie Carre Pizza is the type of pizza with the lowest of all 3 indicators. Need to find out why customers don't like this type of pizza to adjust or eliminate it.
- Regularly update popular pizzas to disseminate to employees.
### 3.2. Marketing Strategies
- It is quite unusual that Sundays are the days with the least number of orders of the week while this is a potential weekend. So we need to come up with promotion strategies to increase the number of orders for Sundays.
- February, September, October and December need more promotions to increase the number of orders.
